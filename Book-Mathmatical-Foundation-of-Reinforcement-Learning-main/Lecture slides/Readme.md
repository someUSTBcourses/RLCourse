My lecture slides are put into two folders.

- The folder "slidesForMyLectureVideos" contains all **the slides that I used to record my lecture videos**.

- The folder "slidesContinuouslyUpdated" contains **the slides that I updated continuously**.

The slides in the two folders are very similar, but there are some minor differences, such as typo correction and content adjustment.

**If you are not studying my online lecture videos, I suggest you check the slides in the slidesContinuouslyUpdated folder since they have been improved continuously.**
